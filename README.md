Guide to above available materials:

1. The folder named Sigma Notation consist of unpublished notes of Professor H W Gould on Combinatorial Identities. This notes has now 
   been archived in the form of a book.

This book is one of a kind and contains an extensive collection of identities on sums and products found nowhere else on the web. Proofs are left for self derivation for most of the identities. It can serve as a first course for undergrads refering to some topics and the rest are for a more sophisticated course.

2. The folders on P&C and Binomial Theorem will consist of my handwritten notes based on courses which I took, links to online courses,
   several problem sets and references to "What to read NEXT".
