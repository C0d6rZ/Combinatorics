Guide to above available materials:

1. The folder named Sigma Notation consist of unpublished notes of Professor H W Gould on Combinatorial Identities. This notes has now 
   been archived in the form of a book.
   
This is the amazon link:

This book is one of a kind and contains an extensive collection of identities on sums and products found nowhere else on the web. Proofs are left for self derivation for most of the identities. It can serve as a first course for undergrads refering to some topics and the rest are for a more sophisticated course.

2. The folders on P&C and Binomial Theorem will consist of my handwritten notes based on courses which I took, links to online courses,
   several problem sets and references to "What to read NEXT".
  
3. Texts on Iversion notation

4. Summation of series by L. B. W. Jolley is an extensive collection of series from different branches of mathematics. It is worth 
   looking at and we will be deriving them as we progress with our notes.
   
5. Derangements-essay and partitions_general-essay are essays form Prof. James Tanton. He deals with high school maths 
   and expresses sophisticated concepts in a manner understandable to non-math audience.

   Who is he? ----> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Tanton
   
   He has also written a book named Encyclopaedia of Mathematics which sits in my repo "Mathematical Dictionaries, tables and              Encyclopaedia" ------>  https://github.com/justanotherparadox/Mathematical-Dictionaries-tables-and-Encyclopaedia
   
6. VVI book summation contains theory of indefinite discrete summations and difference equations as well. We will be dealing with them 
   when I upload my notes in Sequences and Series folder.

7. The book on set theory that I have uploaded is not for a beginner and a lot must be learnt before reading the text. I haven't read it    myself and do not feel that I have achieved that level yet.
